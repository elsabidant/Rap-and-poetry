**Project Overview**

This project explores a central question at the intersection of computational linguistics and literary studies:
Are rap lyrics as rich and sophisticated as traditional poetry in their use of rhetorical devices?

**Data**

Two raw datasets were used:
- corpus.csv – Rap dataset from Une exploration numérique du rap français depuis les années 1990 (Courson, 2024)
- corpus_poetica_cleaned.csv – Poetry dataset collected through web scraping

The analysis was conducted using annotated datasets:
- df_poe_annotated.csv – Annotated poetry dataset
- df_rap_annotated.csv – Annotated rap dataset

**Notebooks**

This repository also contains the code used for data collection, annotation, and statistical analysis:
- Scraping and data.ipynb – Data collection and preprocessing
- llm-for-rap-and-poetry.ipynb – LLM-based rhetorical annotation
- Bidant 03 Poetry and rap.ipynb – Statistical analysis and modelling
